# Mini Apertium Website

This repo is an experiment to see how hard it would be to reimplement [apertium-html-tools](https://github.com/apertium/apertium-html-tools) using [HTMX](https://htmx.org).

To try this out, edit the paths in [`main.py`](main.py) and then run

```bash
$ FLASK_APP=main.py flask run --debug
```
